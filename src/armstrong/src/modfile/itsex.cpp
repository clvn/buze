	* IT 2.14/2.15 sample decompression routines.
	*
	* Well.
	* The existance of this file, and the fact that you're just reading this
	* text may upset some people. I know this. I also know about the risks of
	* not only having coded this, but freely releasing it to the public. But
	* well, if this is the end of my life, why not, at least i have done some-
	* thing good to all player coders / game developers with IT fanatic mu-
	* sicians etc. ;)
	*
	* And to make it even worse: A short (?) description of what the routines
	* in this file do.
	*
	* It's all about sample compression. Due to the rather "analog" behaviour
	* of audio streams, it's not always possible to gain high reduction rates
	* with generic compression algorithms. So the idea is to find an algorithm
	* which is specialized for the kind of data we're actually dealing with:
	* mono sample data.
	*
	* in fact, PKZIP etc. is still somewhat better than this algorithm in most
	* cases, but the advantage of this is it's decompression speed which might
	* enable sometimes players or even synthesizer chips to decompress IT
	* samples in real-time. And you can still pack these compressed samples with
	* "normal" algorithms and get better results than these algorothms would
	* ever achieve alone.
	*
	* some assumptions i made (and which also pulse made - and without which it
	* would have been impossible for me to figure out the algorithm) :
	*
	* - it must be possible to find values which are found more often in the
	*   file than others. Thus, it's possible to somehow encode the values
	*   which we come across more often with less bits than the rest.
	* - In general, you can say that low values (considering distance to
	*   the null line) are found more often, but then, compression results
	*   would heavily depend on signal amplitude and DC offsets and such.
	* - But: ;)
	* - higher frequencies have generally lower amplitudes than low ones, just
	*   due to the nature of sound and our ears
	* - so we could somehow filter the signal to decrease the low frequencies'
	*   amplitude, thus resulting in lesser overall amplitude, thus again resul-
	*   ting in better ratios, if we take the above thoughts into consideration.
	* - every signal can be split into a sum of single frequencies, that is a
	*   sum of a(f)*sin(f*t) terms (just believe me if you don't already know).
	* - if we differentiate this sum, we get a sum of (a(f)*f)*cos(f*t). Due to
	*   f being scaled to the nyquist of the sample frequency, it's always
	*   between 0 and 1, and we get just what we want - we decrease the ampli-
	*   tude of the low frequencies (and shift the signal's phase by 90ø, but
	*   that's just a side-effect that doesn't have to interest us)
	* - the backwards way is simple integrating over the data and is completely
	*   lossless. good.
	* - so how to differentiate or integrate a sample stream? the solution is
	*   simple: we simply use deltas from one sample to the next and have the
	*   perfectly numerically differentiated curve. When we decompress, we
	*   just add the value we get to the last one and thus restore the original
	*   signal.
	* - then, we assume that the "-1"st sample value is always 0 to avoid nasty
	*   DC offsets when integrating.
	*
	* ok. now we have a sample stream which definitely contains more low than
	* high values. How do we compress it now?
	*
	* Pulse had chosen a quite unusual, but effective solution: He encodes the
	* values with a specific "bit width" and places markers between the values
	* which indicate if this width would change. He implemented three different
	* methods for that, depending on the bit width we actually have (i'll write
	* it down for 8 bit samples, values which change for 16bit ones are in these
	* brackets [] ;):
	*
	* method 1: 1 to 6 bits
	* * there are two possibilities (example uses a width of 6)
	*   - 100000 (a one with (width-1) zeroes ;) :
	*     the next 3 [4] bits are read, incremented and used as new width...
	*     and as it would be completely useless to switch to the same bit
	*     width again, any value equal or greater the actual width is
	*     incremented, thus resulting in a range from 1-9 [1-17] bits (which
	*     we definitely need).
	*   - any other value is expanded to a signed byte [word], integrated
	*     and stored.
	* method 2: 7 to 8 [16] bits
	* * again two possibilities (this time using a width of eg. 8 bits)
	*   - 01111100 to 10000011 [01111000 to 10000111] :
	*     this value will be subtracted by 01111011 [01110111], thus resulting
	*     again in a 1-8 [1-16] range which will be expanded to 1-9 [1-17] in
	*     the same manner as above
	*   - any other value is again expanded (if necessary), integrated and
	*     stored
	* method 3: 9 [17] bits
	* * this time it depends on the highest bit:
	*   - if 0, the last 8 [16] bits will be integrated and stored
	*   - if 1, the last 8 [16] bits (+1) will be used as new bit width.
	* any other width isnt supposed to exist and will result in a premature
	* exit of the decompressor.
	*
	* Few annotations:
	* - The compressed data is processed in blocks of 0x8000 bytes. I dont
	*   know the reason of this (it's definitely NOT better concerning compres-
	*   sion ratio), i just think that it has got something to do with Pulse's
	*   EMS memory handling or such. Anyway, this was really nasty to find
	*   out ;)
	* - The starting bit width is 9 [17]
	* - IT2.15 compression simply doubles the differentiation/integration
	*   of the signal, thus eliminating low frequencies some more and turning
	*   the signal phase to 180ø instead of 90ø which can eliminate some sig-
	*   nal peaks here and there - all resulting in a somewhat better ratio.
	*
	* ok, but now lets start... but think before you easily somehow misuse
	* this code, the algorithm is (C) Jeffrey Lim aka Pulse... and my only
	* intention is to make IT's file format more open to the Tracker Community
	* and especially the rest of the scene. Trackers ALWAYS were open standards,
	* which everyone was able (and WELCOME) to adopt, and I don't think this
	* should change. There are enough other things in the computer world
	* which did, let's just not be mainstream, but open-minded. Thanks.
