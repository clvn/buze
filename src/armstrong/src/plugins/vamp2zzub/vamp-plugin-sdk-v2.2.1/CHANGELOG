Version 2.2.1, 2011-04-05 (maintenance release):

  * Minor build fixes for OS/X

Version 2.2, 2010-08-26 (maintenance release):

  * Fixes to OS/X build procedures so as to build three-way
    universal binaries (PPC, i386, x86_64) by default.  Forced upon
    us by OS/X 10.6 defaulting to 64-bit rather than 32-bit

Version 2.1, 2009-09-22 (maintenance and minor feature release):

  * Add ProcessTimestampMethod to PluginInputDomainAdapter, offering
    the ability to decide how data buffering and timestamping works for
    frequency-domain plugins (whose process timestamps have to be at
    the centre of each processing block rather than the start)
  * Make PluginBufferingAdapter take into account any timestamp shift
    introduced by a PluginInputDomainAdapter that it wraps
  * Fix crash in PluginAdapter when plugin library getDescriptor fails
    on plugin construction
  * Add plugin skeleton files as starting point for new developers

Version 2.0, 2008-12-08 (major release):

  * Feature structure now has an optional duration (plugin API change)
  * Libraries reorganised into separate include and src directories for
    plugin and host SDKs; hosts should no longer include from vamp-sdk/
    but always from vamp-hostsdk/ instead (host source compatibility change)
  * OutputDescriptor now declares whether its features will have duration
  * Vamp RDF ontology now included for providing online (out-of-plugin)
    descriptions of plugins; program to generate skeleton RDF for a plugin
    set is included, and RDF for example plugins provided
  * New PluginSummarisingAdapter providing averages, min/max, count etc
    of returned features on request
  * New example plugins: Fixed Tempo Estimator and Power Spectrum
  * Command-line host now has a complete listing option, to print out
    all data reported by plugins
  * More complete Visual Studio project support

Version 1.3, 2008-07-09 (maintenance release):

  * PluginBufferingAdapter has several important fixes to bugs that
    could cause incorrect timings or output descriptors to be returned
  * Conversion between real-time and frames has been improved to avoid
    rounding error in round-trip calculations
  * Plugin lookup no longer relies on non-portable DT_REG
  * The SDK now compiles with gcc 4.3

Version 1.2, 2008-02-28 (feature release):

  * New PluginBufferingAdapter, which hosts may use to avoid having to
    negotiate the plugin's preferred input step and block sizes

Version 1.1, 2007-08-24 (feature release):

  * New Vamp::HostExt namespace
  * PluginLoader class, which handles enumeration, loading and category
    management for plugins on the local system
  * PluginInputDomainAdapter, which provides the capability for a host
    to support frequency-domain plugins without needing to worry about
    domain conversion
  * PluginChannelAdapter, which transparently deals with plugins that
    expect different numbers of audio channels from the number available
  * Minor beauty-and-truth updates and documentation fixes

Version 1.0, 2007-03-21:

  * First official release
