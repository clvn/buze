<h1>Tips</h1>
<h2>Get inspired</h2>
<p>
Print the whole manual + cheatsheats, and carry it around it while you are on the bus, train or just on a holiday.
It pays off, seriously.
</p>

<h2>Use the Lunar plugins</h2>
<p>
Buze is shipped with many Lunar plugins (Reverb/Compressor/Gain/Distortion/etc). 
Use them as much as possible to promote sharing and portability of songs.
</p>

<h2>Use Note Generators (with) VST plugins</h2>
<p>
Get used to connecting Note Generators/MIDI Trackers to plugins.
A VST plugin is just an effect or an generator, so it needs something
extra to have notes send to it.
</p>

<h2>Learn the keys</h2>
<p>
Know what the F-keys do.
Also Alt-backspace on samples or machines always show properties.
ESC always goes back (to the previously state/focused window).
</p>

<h2>(Multiple) screen layouts</h2>
<p>
Hold CTRL and drag a tab into another tab.
This way you can combine views with one another.
Don't forget to store it as a screenlayout, then you can
recall the views later using the numpad buttons.
</p>

<h2>Rename your machines </h2>
<p>
Select a machine -> Alt-backspace -> (keydown) -> enter name -> ESC
</p>

<h2>Show hide the paramviews</h2>
<p>
If you doubleclick a machine, it opens the paramview.
Instead of ending up in a neverending open/close clicky-madness, just
leave your paramviews open (and hit F12 to hide/unhide them).
</p>

<h2>Combined machineview</h2>
<p>
Hold CTRL and click a tab of a parameterview, and release it on top
of another parameterview. This way you can combine them.
</p>

<h2>Templates: Build your typical-studio</h2>
<p>
Many audioengineers use specific combinations of effects over and over again.
The great thing about buze, is that it's modular, but not perse.
Once you have a great combination of effects, just select these machines, and rightclick:
'Save Selection As'. Enter for example 'mysuperreverb.armz' and you saved it as a preset.
When entering 'mysuperreverb' in the machineview, you will have it under your fingertips.
</p>

<h2>Remember your favorite plugins/instruments</h2>
<p>
If you have 1000 soundfonts/presets/synth, and at one day you find the-best-sounding-string-ever, 
or the-best-preset-ever, you can just rightclick the plugin -> 'Save Selection As' -> 'superstring.armz'.
When entering 'superstring' in the machineview, you will have it under your fingertips.
</p>

<h2>Smart MIDI mapping</h2>
<p>
Of course you can map everything to MIDI using rightclicks on sliders in the parameterview.
But, if you have particular wishes, write your own script in the scripting view.
There are example scripts their which demonstrate scripted MIDI-mappings.
</p>

<h2>Recycle your sound</h2>
<p>
Any machine can be rightclicked, and its output can be rendered to the wavetable.
This is handy in situations of too CPU-intensive songs, or just to refactor yourself into simplicity.
</p>

<h2>Help what does this machine do?</h2>
<p>
When opening the parameterview of a machine, press the help icon.
It will then try to open a .html, .txt, .pdf file carrying the same name of the machine (without dll).
(So if you install plugins, it can help to rename the docs)
Also, in any case press F1 in case of doubt.
</p>
<h2>Keep machineview tidy</h2>
<p>
For machines which are small details, rightclick it, and press 'minimize'.
</p>
<h2>Separate notes &amp; automation in 1 pattern</h2>
<p>
It is handy to have 'note view' and a 'envelope view'.
So you can switch between the musical data, and the automations of
effects etc.
<br/><br/>
1. Create envelope columns where necessary (hit CTRL-t on non-note columns)<br/>
2. Optionally select an envelope-type using the rightclick contextmenu<br/>
3. Hide all non-note related columns using CTRL-k<br/>
4. Select all: CTRL-| (several times) <br/>
5. Hit CTRL-k to toggle between views..voila!<br/>
</p>
<h2>Reroute notes</h2>
<p>
Did you know you can reroute notes?
If you use Note Generators, you can send its output to other
Note Generators, or MIDI Trackers.
Also MIDI-plugins can be usefull in this situation.
</p>
<h2>Send MIDI to your external gear</h2>
<p>
1. Make sure you have configured at least one MIDI-output in the preferences screen.<br/>
2. Now add an 'MIDI Out' Machine and optionally a 'MIDI Tracker' machine.<br/>
3. Rightclick the 'MIDI Out' Machine and select a midi-output.<br/>
4. Connect the 'MIDI Tracker' to the 'MIDI Out' machine. <br/>
5. Click the 'MIDI Tracker' machine and hit some keyboardkeys.<br/>
You will now hear some notes being send to your external gear.<br/>
