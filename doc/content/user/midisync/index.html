<h1>Syncing external MIDI with Buzé</h1>

<p>
	This describes syncing stop/stop in Buzé with an external application over MIDI, using the virtual MIDI Yoke drivers in MIDI-OX as a virtual MIDI cable between the applications.
</p>

<p>
	Get and install <a href="http://www.midiox.com">MIDI-OX</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Set up MIDI routings in MIDI-OX. A simple setup may look like this:

<p>
	Start your host, e.g Reaper and go to MIDI preferences. Select the virtual MIDI-OX output port the host should send midi to, and make sure sending of SPP is enabled.

	Now, when you press "Play" in your host, Buzé should start playing too.
