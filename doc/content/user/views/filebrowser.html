<h1>File Browser</h1>
<p>The file browser shows audio files and archives of supported formats on the computer, supports live preview playback and can load samples into the 
wavetable.</p>
<p>
	The file browser can be opened with Shift+F9. Or press ENTER when a slot in the wavetable has focus.
</p>

<h2>Supported file formats</h2>
<p>
	The file browser uses the stream plugins in Armstrong for live preview. The stream plugins use libsndfile or libmad to load and play
	files directly from disk. libsndfile supports WAV, AIFF, FLAC, AU and many more formats, whereas libmad is a library for playing back MP3.
</p>
<p>
	The file browser uses the sample import API in Armstrong for browsing sample archives and loading sample data into the project. 
	The import API supports most regular wave formats via libsndfile and libmad, and also (non-previewable) samples from .mod/.s3m/.it/.xm and 
	.drumkit files as archives.
</p>
<p>
	Supported archive file formats can be browsed like any directory. In order to load a sample from disk or from an archive, just drag 
	the file into a slot in the wavetable. Or press ENTER to load the sample into the currently selected wavetable slot.
