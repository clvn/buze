<h1>Wave Table</h1>

<p>
	The wavetable gives access to an internal cache of waveforms available to tracker plugins.
</p>

<p>
	There are four sections in the wavetable view:
</p>

<p>
	<b>The instrument list</b> has 200 slots for sample-based instruments.
</p>
<p>
	<b>The wavelevel list</b> contains samples in an instrument.
</p>
<p>
	<b>The wave editor</b> allows for basic editing of samples.
</p>
<p>
	<b>The edit, envelope and slice tabs</b>.
</p>

<h2>Working with the wavetable</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use a tracker plugin such as Matilde Tracker and FuzzPilz UnwieldyTracker to play samples from the wavetable in a project.</li>
	<li>Drag files from Windows' Explorer, or open the File Browser inside Buze and drag waveforms from there.</li>
	<li>Preview samples by double clicking or playing notes on the keyboard. The File Browser can also preview samples directly from disk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The wavetable toolbar</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		<b>Clear wave</b>: Clears the currently selected instrument and all samples in it.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Save wave</b>: Saves the first sample of the currently selected instrument as a WAV to disk.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Scale: Samples</b>: Tells the wave editor to display the scales in samples.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Scale: Time</b>: Tells the wave editor to display the scales in minutes and seconds.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Scale: Ticks</b>: Tells the wave editor to display the scales in ticks, based on the global BPM/TPB.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Scale: Hex</b>: Tells the wave editor to display the scales in hex-percent, compatible with Matilde and UnwieldyTracker's "sample offset" commands.
		The hex scale always goes from 0-FFFF, relative to the sample length. The last two digits can be discarded on Matilde Tracker. I.e, for the scale xxyy, Mtrk: 09/xx, and Utrk: xxyy
	</p>
