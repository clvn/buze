<h1>Using JACK</h1>
<p>
	JACK is a mechanism to route audio and MIDI in real-time between applications from different vendors. This solves the same problem as Rewire.
</p>
<p>
	If JACK is installed, it can be selected in Preferences -> Audio, and also from Preferences -> MIDI. 
	The MIDI devices work only if the JACK audio driver is selected.

<p>
	Buzé initializes JACK with 16 audio output channels and 16 audio input channels (16 + 16 audio ports).
	The channels are automatically routed to the physical JACK audio ports, and leaving any remaining channels for aux.
</p>
<p>
	Buzé initializes JACK with a MIDI input port and a MIDI output port. Note these ports are not routed in JACK by default.

<h2>MIDI in JACK for Windows</h2>
<p>
	Make sure to "-X winmme" on the jackd startup options:

<h2>JACK in other applications</h2>
<p>
	On a basic level, an application needs only to support ASIO in order to work with JACK:
	When installing JACK on Windows, it installs a new virtual JackRouter ASIO device by default. Any applications using this audio driver,
	can send and receive audio from other applications connected to JACK. 
</p>
<p>
	The JackRouter ASIO device by itself does not deal with MIDI and synchronization, and will require virtual MIDI cables or a JACK-enabled VST.
