    <h2>Q: Where can I get (human) help?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Goto #buze of EFNET with your IRCclient (like mIRC), we will be there .
	</p>
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
    <h2>Q: What are the keyboard shortcuts?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b>Hit F1 to show the keyboard shortcut overview for the focused view. Hit F1 twice to see global keyboard shortcuts.
	</p>
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
    <h2>Q: How to get not confused by pattern(formats)?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Remember, hitting ESC will always take you back to the main/default pattern.

	</p>

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
   <h2>Q: How can I nest patterns like in Buzz?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Add a 'Pattern Player'-machine. Go to the patternformat editor (shift-F2), and tick the 'Trigger' checkbox of the 'Pattern Player'-machine. A column appears, and if you enter '00', a nested patternblock will appear. Hit enter to enter the pattern, and ESC to leave. Once you are inside your nested patternblock, you can hit shift-F2 again to add columns to it.

	</p>

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
    <h2>Q: How do I render audio?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> Rightclick the master (or any machine), and choose 'Render To'. From there you can render the machine's output to a file, or a wave in the wavetable.
	</p>
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
    <h2>Q: My VST instrument does not make sound?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A:</b> You forgot to connect a 'Note Generator'-machine to it. By doing so, you will also be able to send notes to your plugin in the patterneditor. Optionally a 'MIDI Tracker' can be used. Remember it once, and you're done.
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
    <h2>Q: Can Buzé co-exist with Buzz?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Yes, theoretically, although the programs have grown apart to such as a degree it may be considered beneficial to maintain two installations.
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>Q: How to install?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Unpack the zip, add plugins and start buze.exe. Check out the <a href="plugins/index.html">documentation</a> for the individual plugin wrappers on how and where to install plugins.
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <!--h2>Q: Can you recommend a good Buzz pack?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b>These are the Buzz distributions I know of:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b><a href="http://www.buzzmachines.com/getbuzz.php">buzzmachines.com</a></b><br />
				The original Buzz packs. Massive (655 machines) and Stealth (72 machines) packs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><a href="http://www.buzzformat.com/">buzzformat.com</a></b><br />
				CyanPhase's distros with Overloader. Mini (46 machines) and Tiny (14 machines) packs.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><a href="http://ekral.com/?page_id=4">ekral.com</a></b><br />
				Ekral's Buzz From Scratch. Contains all you need to install Buzz with many machines in a single archive, but you 
				have to unpack and install them yourself.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><a href="http://www.plosive.net/buzz/install.html">plosive.net</a></b><br />
				Mute's Buzz Installer. Features a selective collection of Buzz machines.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b><a href="http://www.djlaser.com/buzz/">djlaser.com</a></b><br />
				DJ Laser's Jeskola Buzz Starter Pack.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		There will probably be an official Buzé distribution some time in the future, but right now other things have higher priority.

    <h2>
    Q: I get this error message when Buzé starts: MI.H: GetInfo() called
    </h2>
	<p>
		<img src="load-error-3.png" alt="MI.H: GetInfo() called"/>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> This message appears when Paniq's Plutonium is initialized. While it is a harmless message, this machine is defunct
		and can safely be deleted.
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>Q: I get the error message above (or some other error message), but I cannot press OK or X...</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> You might have (an older version of) Gear/Generators/CyanPhase Buzz Overloader.dll. Please delete it - Buzé will not work when it is there.
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>
    Q: What is the deal with the text mode console window that opens on startup?
    </h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Unless you started Buzé with a /debug parameter, this window appears when Paniq's Pybuzz is initialized. Whenever Pybuzz is used, it will print debug messages and
		other output to this window. 
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>Q: Buzé crashes on startup...</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Buzz and Buzé normally crashes on startup for the same reason: unstable machines. While we have attempted to put the most well-known broken machines in blacklist.txt, you will occasionally
		need to track down unstable machines by yourself. Use a tool such as Dependency Walker or buze.exe /debug to help finding problem DLLs. If you encounter a machine that you think ought to be placed in the blacklist, please let us know by logging a bug report.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Known startup problems:</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The presence of Gear/Generators/CyanPhase Buzz Overloader.dll crashes on startup (solution: delete file)</li>
		<li>Drivers for Samson C01U USB Mic are reported to cause startup crashes (solution: uninstall driver)</li>
		<li>Device named "ASIO DirectX Full Duplex Driver" is known to cause problems, and may crash on startup unless audio driver buffer size is set to 512 (solution: use another driver)</li>
		<li>Audio driver initialization may halt if there are non-existent (USB) ASIO devices in the registry. (solution: delete unused ASIO device entries in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ASIO)</li>
	</ul>

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>Q: I get noise bursts...</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> You are apparently using a broken machine. Don't do that. Find out which machine causes the noise and delete it.
		If you encounter a machine that causes noise bursts, please let us know by logging a bug report.
	</p>

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

	<h2>Q: Can Buzé use VSTs?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Yes. Buzé now supports VST and VSTi natively, with access to most parameters and features directly. By default, plugins are loaded from Gear/VST, but this can be 
		changed in Preferences -> Plugins -> VST Paths.
	</p>
	<p>
		Buzé also supports VSTs through the Buzz wrapper: The Polac VST plugins enable both VST and VSTI. Make sure you have <a href="http://www.xlutop.com/buzz">latest 
		version</a> though.
	</p>

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
	
    <h2>Q: I have problems with a machine I use a lot in Buzz...</h2>
	<p>
		First make sure you have all DLLs the machine needs. Some machines use runtime libraries from Visual Studio, such as
		msvcp60.dll, msvcrt.dll and these must exist on your system, either in Buzés program folder or in c:\windows\system32.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Polac VST &amp; Polac VSTi:</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The index.txt entries are not expanded with subdirectories like in original Buzz.</li>
		<li>When selecting a VST instrument from its right click menu, the machine changes its name in Buzz. This hack has not been successfully implemented in Buzé.</li>
		<li>If PVST crashes when you connect it to the master, make sure you are using the latest version of both PVST and Buzé.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<b>All WaveOut/WaveIn machines, Jeskola/Polac ASIO In/Out machines:</b><br />
		These machines depend on functionality in Buzz' native wave output drivers, which are not available in libzzub.
		Use the built-in Audio Input and Audio Output plugins instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>BTDSys PeerCtrl, BTDSys PeerCtrl 'Basic', BTDSys LiveJumpHACK:</b><br />
		These machines use known offset hacks and were attempted patched, but caused the wrapper to fail altogether. Therefore, they
		are currently blacklisted as they will cause trouble no matter what.
	</p>

		Please see the separate <a href="ldmixer.html">ld mixer 1.03 checklist</a> page.

    <h2>Q: I have problems with a VST I use a lot in another sequencer...</h2>
	<p>
		Please report any problematic VSTs in our bugtracker. Our VST wrapper is a work in progress.
	</p>
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>Q: Does Buzé crash if I use any of the machines utilizing hacks?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> No, most likely not. The Buzz machine wrapper patches several known hacks to prohibit crashes.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a list of the currently patched plugins, have a look at Gear/Native/buzz2zzub.ini, which controls patching options per DLL.
		The .ini-file has some documentation, which shortly explains the purpose of each patch option.
		Patched plugins are probably safe to use, although if their core functionality is based on hacks they may not (yet) function properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are a machine author using hacks in your Buzz machine (not recommended), make sure the supported patches
		are enabled in buzz2zzub.ini for it to work as expected in Buzz. The wrapper does not support any direct GUI-hacks, such as responding
		to correct window messages, but instead focuses on the memory offset hacks used by several popular plugins.
	</p>

    <!--h2>Q: I can't get any sound after enabling a DirectSound recording device, only Elapsed Time counts, but nothing happens in the sequencer...</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Try to reduce the hardware acceleration level to "Basic Acceleration". (start dxdiag.exe from Start->Run 
		and check for a Hardware Sound Acceleration Level slider the Sound tab). Note that changing this setting may introduce problems 
		later if you are using e.g the kX Project ASIO drivers with other audio applications.
	</p>
	
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" /-->

    <!--h2>Q: Buzé is slower than Buzz!</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> You are right, of course. And just to make it clear, the original Buzz will always run smoother than Buzé on the same hardware for several reasons:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Everything is stereo in libzzub: generators always produce a stereo signal, and effects only see stereo connections. Buzz allows parts of plugin chains to be processed in mono,
		whereas this behaviour has been deprecated in libzzub. This makes it easier for developers to create new, native stereo plugins, but has the unfortunate side effect of 
		spending twice the CPU in some Buzz plugins.</li>
		<li>Everything is non-interleaved in libzzub: because the audio buffers in zzub and Buzz have different internal formats, there is a small overhead when the Buzz wrapper converts between them.</li>
		<li>Oskari is better than us. At least he has put a good amount of work into optimizing Buzz. Our efforts have prioritized correctness over speed so far.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" /-->

    <!--h2>Q: What is aliases.txt?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> This file is meant for mapping plugin namespaces into each other, but no longer has any practical use. Buzé will auto-generate 
		aliases for all DLLs in Gear/Generators and Gear/Effects to relieve the user of maintaining aliases.txt.
		Currently, its only application is to allow using native zzub-plugins in place of missing Buzz machines. (Deprecated in Buzé 0.5.3 and newer)
	</p>

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" /-->

    <h2>Q: How can I report a bug?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> The one place to keep bug reports and feature requests is in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/u/anders-e/buze/tickets/">ticket database</a>. 
		To enter tickets, you will need a Sourceforge account.
	</p>

	<!--hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />
    <h2>Q: What is signature.h and why is it missing from the SVN repository?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> This is a file that is normally generated when building with SCons. At the moment, there is no mechanism
		in place to generate it when building with Visual Studio. Meanwhile, get one <a href="http://www.batman.no/signature.h">here</a> and
		copy it into src/zzub/include.

		
		The file contains a single constant string that
		uniquely identifies the version of the build. In order for a plugin to load, it must be built with the same signature as the host.
		
	</p-->

	<hr size="1px" color="#ccc" />

    <h2>Q: Did you buy the Buzzlib license from Oskari Tammelin and is it possible to use libzzub in commercial projects?</h2>
	<p>
		A: The libzzub/Buzé project owns a Buzzlib license, which was aqcuired mainly to distribute binaries legally. None of the buzzlib code
		has been used in libzzub or Buzé. Unfortunately the overall licensing scheme is quite messy. Buzé is released under the same license as WTL.
		libzzub is LGPL, which means you can use the replayer engine in a commercial project as long as any changes you make to libzzub are returned to the 
		community.
	</p>
	<p>
		libzzub uses a Buzz-wrapper to provide support for original Buzz machines. The wrapper is GPL-licensed, except Oskaris original headers
		which have the following notice: 
<pre>
// This header file may be used to write _freeware_ DLL "machines" for Buzz
// Using it for anything else is not allowed without a permission from the author
</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I am not a lawyer, but I think you should talk to <a href="http://jeskola.net/">Oskari</a> if you want to use libzzubs Buzz-wrapper commercially. 
	</p>

    <h2>Q: What's the difference/purpose/relationship of all this Buzé, BuzzRMX, Aldrin, Neil, Armstrong, libzzub, libneil-stuff?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> Aldrin, Buzé, Buzz RMX and Neil are different Buzz clones with entirely different design goals. All four are based on different versions of 
		the same replayer engine. 
	</p>
	<p>
		libzzub is the name of the replayer engine originally split off from an early version of Buzé. Later libzzub went through a major rewrite and renamed to Armstrong. 
		Armstrong has gone through yet another major rewrite since then.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://aldrin.sf.net/">Aldrin</a> is a successor of Jeskola Buzz developed mainly on and for the Linux operating system.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.batman.no/buze/">Buzé</a> is a modern remake of Jeskola Buzz for Windows. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.buzzrmx.com/">Buzz RMX</a> is a 1:1 remake of Jeskola Buzz for Windows. It is forked from an an earlier version of Aldrin and is
		intended as a pick-up point for developers that want to tweak and extend the original Buzz user interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://www.batman.no/buze/">Armstrong</a> is an open source platform independent C/C++ music tracking and sequencing library.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/neilsequencer/">Neil</a> is an active open source fork of Aldrin.
	</p>
	<p>
		libzzub is the former name of Armstrong. The "zzub" prefix is often seen in the source code still.
	</p>

    <h2>Q: How do I pronounce Buzé?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>A: </b> It's pronounced with a french accent, preferably in a slightly gay tone. Try yourself: Buh-zeh, buh-zeh, buh-zeh.
	</p>
