<h1>Build instructions</h1>
<h2>Required tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-express-vs">Visual Studio Express 2012 for Desktop</a> with at least Update 1. Non-express and newer versions are assumed to work</li>
	<li><a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a> or your preferred Subversion client</li>
</ul>
<p>
	VS2010 works, but only after editing the project files to use the correct platform toolset. 
	Project files for VS2008 and older are no longer maintained.
</p>
<h2>Install Boost</h2>
<p>
	Download and install precompiled 32 bit library binaries of latest Boost from 
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/">the Boost download page</a>. For VS2012, choose the msvc-11.0-32 build.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Armstrong requires Boost version 1.53 or newer!</b> Armstrong depends on boost::lockfree and boost::atomic which were adopted in
	Boost version 1.53.
</p>
<p>
	All other dependencies on Windows except Boost are kept in the repository and must be copied into the working directory as described below.
</p>

<h2>Download source codes and other dependencies from the repository</h2>

Using the command line - note the very important steps where win32deps is <i>*exported*</i> from trunk and manually <i>*copied*</i> into the working directory:
<pre style="background-color:black; color:white; font-family:'courier new'; font-size:13px">
	C:\Users\clvn\Code> md buzesrc
	C:\Users\clvn\Code> cd buzesrc
	C:\Users\clvn\Code\buzesrc> svn co svn://anders-e.com/buze/trunk/buze buze
	...
	C:\Users\clvn\Code\buzesrc> svn export svn://anders-e.com/buze/trunk/win32deps depfiles
	...
	C:\Users\clvn\Code\buzesrc> xcopy depfiles buze /s
	...
</pre>


Optionally checkout the docs, website and installer files:
<pre style="background-color:black; color:white; font-family:'courier new'; font-size:13px">
	C:\Users\clvn\Code\buzesrc> svn co svn://anders-e.com/buze/trunk/docs docs
	...
	C:\Users\clvn\Code\buzesrc> svn co svn://anders-e.com/buze/trunk/installer installer
	...
</pre>

<h2>Install additional dependencies</h2>
<p>
	In addition to Boost and the DirectX SDK, there are also several other mandatory libraries required for Armstrong.
	Pre-built dependency binaries for Windows exist in the win32deps directory in the trunk. This directory must be exported separately and moved into the working copy directory:
</p>
<p>
	Go to c:\buzesrc in Explorer and create a new directory called "deps". Right-click the new directory and choose TortoiseSVN -> Export...Enter
	svn://anders-e.com/buze/trunk/win32deps as URL for the repository to export. Click OK and wait while TortoiseSVN downloads the dependencies.
</p>
<p>
	When the export is finished, the next step is to move the contents of deps into the buze folder: Go to c:\buzesrc\deps in Explorer and select all the files. Right-click the selected files and choose "Cut". 
	Now go to c:\buzesrc\buze, right-click and select "Paste" to move all files from the deps-directory into the Buze-directory. Answer "Yes to all" to the following question on whether you'd like to overwrite.
</p-->


<!--h2>Configure Armstrong before first build</h2>
<p>
	Open a Visual Studio command prompt, and change directory to c:\buzesrc\buze\src\armstrong. Enter the following command:
</p>
<pre>
	# scons configure PREFIX=c:\buzesrc\buze\src\armstrongbuilder
</pre>
<p>
	The output should look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
	scons: Reading SConscript files ...
	Checking for 'sse' CPU flag... (cached) ERROR: not supported for this platform.
	Checking for 'sse2' CPU flag... (cached) ERROR: not supported for this platform.
	
	Finished configuration.
	
			  === Using ===
			    CoreAudio: no
				 JACK: no
				 ALSA: no
				  OSS: no
		Use SSE CPU Extension: no
	       Use SSE2 CPU Extension: no

		    Library Directory: C:\buzesrc\buze\src\armstrongbuilder\lib
	
		  Generate Debug Info: True
	
	Please check if above settings reflect what you want, then build libzzub using
		scons
	To install scons, run
		[sudo] scons install
</pre-->


<h2>Configure Boost paths in Visual Studio</h2>
<p>
	If Boost was installed in the step above, Visual Studio needs to know where to locate its headers and libraries.
</p>
<p>
	First start Visual Studio and open buzesrc\buze\buze.sln. Go to the Property Manager and view the properties of "Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user" 
	under one of the project configurations.
</p>
<p>
	In VS Express, this is in the menu under View -> Other Windows -> Property Manager. 
	Also note that in VS Express the Property Manager is hidden by default. It can be enabled via Tools -> Setting -> Expert settings. (<a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/e7b6559e-b0c2-453a-bae6-4234a408fe4e/cannot-open-property-manager-in-visual-c-2010-express-edition">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.gockelhut.com/2009/11/visual-studio-2010-property-sheets-and.html">here</a>)
</p>
<p>
	The following paths should be updated to match where Boost was installed. This example assumes Boost version 1.55 with prebuilt binaries for VS2012:
</p>
<p>
<b>Include Directories:</b><br />
c:\boost_1_55_0\
</p>
<p>
<b>Library Directories:</b><br />
c:\boost_1_55_0\lib32-msvc-11.0
</p>


<h2>Build with Visual Studio</h2>
<p>
	With all the source code and dependencies in place, building should be a matter of opening buzesrc\buze\buze.sln in Visual Studio and choose Build -> Build Solution.
</p>
<p>
	If you get build errors on the first attempt, first check under Build -> Configuration Manager and make sure the "Build" checkboxes are checked for all projects.
</p>
<p>
	After successful compilation, buzesrc\buze contains new binaries for a core Buzé install with all standard GUI plugins.
