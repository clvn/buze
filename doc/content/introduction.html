<h1>Introduction</h1>

	Buzé is a full featured, portable modular music tracker that works on Windows and Linux (using Wine). People using it vary from studio bedroom producers to sound designers.

<p>
	Buzé is a multi-plugin DAW, with support for many file formats. A notable distinction of the Buze is its ableton-like envelope. You also have a number of workflow options including piano rolls, you can design custom pattern layouts, you have dynamic midi and audio routing and you can combine different pattern-resolutions. Like a standard DAW, you can use Buze for wave audio editing, midi controlling and more! You can utilize the multifaaceted Buze as a sampler, software synth, audio editor or sequencer.

<p>
	Buzé sports a no non-sense interface. Its easy to learn and will help you increase your musical productivity. The best thing about Buze is that its free, and it supports a gazillion of free downloadable 
	instrument/effects. All you have to do is download it, run it, get machines, get samples, and enjoy your free portable software studio.
